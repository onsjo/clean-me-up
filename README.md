# Clean Me Up Rest

* Logs are kept in a super secure server that is fully GDPR compliant.

## TODO:
* Add unit tests (ongoing)
* Extract interface(s)
* Validate/sanity check input (started)
* Secrets in external storage (like Vault)
* Domain object to wrap bad legacy SmtpEmail (could probably do better, builder perhaps?)
